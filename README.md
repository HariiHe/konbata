# konbata

### What is it?
Konbata is a python libary, that allows you to covert a file.
It transforms the input format into the output format, by using an internal data structure.

At least, this is the goal of the project.

### Open Questions
I am not sure, if I clearly understand the difference between convert and format.
For me, both verbs are used to describe the transformation of one state into another.
If you know better, let me know! I am curious to hear your explanation.
Until now, both definitions are used equally.

### Why does the world need this?
Simple, there are just to many file formats (see some file formats below).
And almost every tool needs its data in another file format.
This is where konbata comes in place, it serves as interface between tools and file formats.


Just a list of some file formats:
xml, csv, json, html, txt, ...
