#### What is it?
Konbata is a python libary, that allows you to covert a file.
It formats the content of the input file into the output format, by using an internal data structure.

At least, this is the goal of the project.
It can also be used as an tool in the terminal.

#### Why does the world need this?
Simple, there are just too many file formats (see some file formats below).
And almost every tool needs its data in another file format.
This is where konbata comes in place, it serves as interface between tools and file formats.


Just a list of some file formats:
xml, csv, json, html, txt, ...

## Usage
```
konbata.py [-h] [-sa] [-sh] [-g] [-del DELIMITER] [-opt OPTIONS]
           input_file output_file
```
